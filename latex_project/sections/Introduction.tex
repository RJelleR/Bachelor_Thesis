\section{Introduction}\label{s:intro}
Statistical moments such as the mean and the variance are essential tools to characterize data and its distribution. Moments of even higher order are useful regarding the shape of the distribution. Less known moments, however, are the fractional moments. While these moments may not  be that significant in comparison with the first for integer moments of a distribution, they can be very useful in certain applications. While these moments can be obtained by ordinary integration, the field of fractional calculus, which finds many application in physics, provides a more general framework to compute these moments. In this paper, we will combine the aforementioned technique with the Moment Generating Function to obtain new expressions for the fractional moments of a distribution.
