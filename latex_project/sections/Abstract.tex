\section*{Abstract}
This thesis introduces a novel approach for computing moments of fractional order by combining the moment generating function with techniques from fractional calculus. The accuracy of the method depends on the specific derivative used, and errors tend to increase with larger parameter values of the underlying distribution. By making use of moments of fractional order, statistics such as the standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis are computed in a unique manner to analyze and forecast volatility of stock returns in financial markets. A fractional generalization of downside risk measures is proposed, which can be used to capture both the frequency and magnitude of negative returns. Additionally, moments of fractional order are integrated into regression models, reducing errors and improving prediction performance compared to models using traditional regressors. Whenever closed-form expressions of the moment generating function are unavailable, numerical approximations have been used for the computations, ensuring stable and reliable results.
