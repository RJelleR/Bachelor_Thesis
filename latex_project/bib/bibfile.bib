  abstract  = {This chapter analyses in detail the concept of fractional moments. The modern mathematical statistics widely uses only four integer moments: the arithmetic mean, the standard deviation (based on the second moment), the measure of asymmetry, and the measure of skewness associated with the value of the fourth moment. Why not increase the moments concept and create a space of real moments, including not only the whole set of integer moments but also the fractional moments? This space of moments will serve as a source of additional information in analysing random functions and sequences in time or frequency domains. The concept of fractional moment is quite new for most of the readers, and, therefore, the description will start from scratch and consider: (a) the definitions of the integer moments; (b) the reconsideration of a random sequence stability problem; (c) the definition of the generalised mean value function; (d) the generalised Pearson correlation function. These new definitions will be helpful to solve the problem of correlations. After reading this chapter, the reader will understand the difference between external and internal correlations and grasp the concept and the directions of application of fractional moments. The examples given in the chapter show the directions of unexpected applications, and more are outlined in the cited authors' publications. The exercises given in this chapter should help to fasten and consolidate the read text.},

No attention has been paid to two formal aspects concerning fractional moments, such as conditions for the existence of the maximum entropy approximation based on them or convergence in entropy of this approximation to F. This paper aims to fill this gap by providing proofs of these two fundamental results. In fact, convergence in entropy can be involved in the optimal selection of the order of fractional moments for accelerating the convergence of the MaxEnt approximation to F, to clarify the entailment relationships of this type of convergence with other types of convergence useful in statistical applications, and to preserve some important prior features of the underlying F distribution.},

  abstract = {Laboratory experiments and field observations indicate that the Q of many non-ferromagnetic inorganic solids is almost frequency independent in the range 10−2–107 c/s, although no single substance has been investigated over the entire frequency spectrum. One of the purposes of this investigation is to find the analytic expression for a linear dissipative mechanism whose Q is almost frequency independent over large frequency ranges. This will be obtained by introducing fractional derivatives in the stress-strain relation.Since the aim of this research is also to contribute to elucidating the dissipating mechanism in the Earth free modes, we shall treat the dissipation in the free, purely torsional, modes of a shell. The dissipation in a plane wave will also be treated.The theory is checked with the new values determined for the Q of spheroidal free modes of the Earth in the range between 10 and 5 min integrated with the Q of Rayleigh waves in the range between 5 and 0·6 min.Another check of the theory is made with the experimental values of the Q of the longitudinal waves in an aluminium rod in the range between 10−5 and 10−3 s.In both checks the theory represents the observed phenomena very satisfactorily. The time derivative which enters the stress-strain relation in both cases is of order 0·15.The present paper is a generalized version of another (Caputo 1966b) in which an elementary definition of some differential operators was used. In this paper we give also a rigorous proof of the formulae to be used in obtaining the analytic expression of Q; moreover, we present two checks of the theory with experimental data.},

  abstract       = {A generalization of probability theory is proposed by using the Riemann–Liouville fractional integrals and the Caputo and Riemann–Liouville fractional derivatives of arbitrary (non-integer and integer) orders. The definition of the fractional probability density function (fractional PDF) is proposed. The basic properties of the fractional PDF are proven. The definition of the fractional cumulative distribution function (fractional CDF) is also suggested, and the basic properties of these functions are also proven. It is proven that the proposed fractional cumulative distribution functions generate unique probability spaces that are interpreted as spaces of a fractional probability theory of arbitrary order. Various examples of the distributions of the fractional probability of arbitrary order, which are defined on finite intervals of the real line, are suggested.},

  abstract = {Here we propose a model-free, non-parametric method to solve an ill-posed inverse problem arising in several fields. It consists of determining a probability density of the lifetime, or the probability of survival of an individual, from the knowledge of the fractional moments of its probability distribution. The two problems are related, but they are different because of the natural normalization condition in each case. We provide a maximum entropy based approach to solve both problems. This problem provides a concrete framework to analyze an interesting problem in the theory of exponential models for probability densities. The central issue that comes up concerns the choice of the fractional moments and their number. We find that there are many possible choices that lead to solutions compatible with the data but in all of them, no more than four moments are necessary. The fact that a given data set can be accurately described by different exponential families poses a challenging problem for the model builder when attaching theoretical meaning to the resulting exponential density.}

  abstract = {SUMMARY We propose a class of observation-driven time series models referred to as generalized autoregressive score (GAS) models. The mechanism to update the parameters over time is the scaled score of the likelihood function. This new approach provides a unified and consistent framework for introducing time-varying parameters in a wide class of nonlinear models. The GAS model encompasses other well-known models such as the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity, autoregressive conditional duration, autoregressive conditional intensity, and Poisson count models with time-varying mean. In addition, our approach can lead to new formulations of observation-driven models. We illustrate our framework by introducing new model specifications for time-varying copula functions and for multivariate point processes with time-varying parameters. We study the models in detail and provide simulation and empirical evidence. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract  = {Traditional econometric models assume a constant one-period forecast variance. To generalize this implausible assumption, a new class of stochastic processes called autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) processes are introduced in this paper. These are mean zero, serially uncorrelated processes with nonconstant variances conditional on the past, but constant unconditional variances. For such processes, the recent past gives information about the one-period forecast variance. A regression model is then introduced with disturbances following an ARCH process. Maximum likelihood estimators are described and a simple scoring iteration formulated. Ordinary least squares maintains its optimality properties in this set-up, but maximum likelihood is more efficient. The relative efficiency is calculated and can be infinite. To test whether the disturbances follow an ARCH process, the Lagrange multiplier procedure is employed. The test is based simply on the autocorrelation of the squared OLS residuals. This model is used to estimate the means and variances of inflation in the U.K. The ARCH effect is found to be significant and the estimated variances increase substantially during the chaotic seventies.},

               The last decade has brought dramatic changes in the way that
               researchers analyze economic and financial time series. This book
               synthesizes these recent advances and makes them accessible to
               first-year graduate students. James Hamilton provides the first
               adequate text-book treatments of important innovations such as
               vector autoregressions, generalized method of moments, the economic
               and statistical consequences of unit roots, time-varying variances,
               and nonlinear time series models. In addition, he presents basic
               tools for analyzing dynamic systems (including linear
               representations, autocovariance generating functions, spectral
               analysis, and the Kalman filter) in a way that integrates economic
               theory with the practical difficulties of analyzing and
               interpreting real-world data. Time Series Analysis fills
               an important need for a textbook that integrates economic theory,
               econometrics, and new results. The book is intended to provide
               students and researchers with a self-contained survey of time
               series analysis. It starts from first principles and should be
               readily accessible to any beginning graduate student, while it is
               also intended to serve as a reference book for researchers.

While most of these studies have documented highly significant in-sample parameter estimates and pronounced intertemporal volatility persistence, traditional ex post forecast evaluation criteria suggest that the models provide seemingly poor volatility forecasts. Contrary to this contention, the authors show that volatility models produce strikingly accurate interdaily forecasts for the latent volatility factor that would be of interest in most financial applications. New methods for improved ex post interdaily volatility measurements based on high-frequency intradaily data are also discussed.
